## descriptions about my computer
* I like this computer,I have had it for nearly 3 years and it seems to be running fine. I need to clean up its files though.
* Due to the mac air having a 2gb ram and 64 gb worth of flash storage, I am able to freely download files I need without the system slowing down at all.
